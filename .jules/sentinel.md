## 2026-01-02 - Symlink Path Traversal in File Listings
**Vulnerability:** The `glob` module (and `glob.iglob`) follows symbolic links by default. If `list_cases` scans a directory containing a symlink to a sensitive external directory, it will list the contents (or the symlink itself as a valid entry) without checking if the *resolved* path is still within the intended root. This leads to Information Disclosure.
**Learning:** Checking input paths at the *access* time (e.g., via `validate_case_path` or `is_relative_to`) is necessary but not sufficient for preventing information leaks during *enumeration* or *listing*.
**Prevention:** Always verify that `Path(p).resolve().is_relative_to(ROOT)` is true for every file/directory returned by a scanner/globber before exposing it to the API response.
